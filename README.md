## Parisa-React-Portfolio

## Descriptiom
My react portfolio that uses the latest technologies where I can share my work and collaborate on future projects. 


## Overview

This project was very fun to do. I really like REACT an am eagered to learn more. I found this project to be more junior developer friendly as oppose to some of the past projects. I learned about different structures in how you can set up your components and when you may need to add your components to a folder and use an index.jsx if you are dealing with a large file structured within a component. I like for my code to be mimimal and easy to read so anyone can jump in at anytime and know what is going on. You will see that is why my framework for this challenge is seup the way it is. 


## Installation

Open terminal from the root, enter: npm run start and you will be able to browse through my REACT portfolio and view the various pages.


## Usage

I plan to go in and refactor it so it stands out and give it more of a design aesthetic later on

## Credits

Mainly, relied on going through past activities. I did attent office hours once and a tutoring session to help me get started. I am most proud because I mainly did this assignment by myself. I used Google and Stackoverflow to see different concepts and implementations as well to draw an inspiration.
